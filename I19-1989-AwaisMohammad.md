Containers, as exemplified by Docker, share the host OS kernel, offering lightweight and rapid application deployment with minimal resource overhead. However, they provide process-level isolation and are best suited for running multiple applications on a single OS. On the other hand, VMs operate by running complete OS instances on top of a hypervisor, resulting in higher resource consumption and longer startup times. VMs excel in providing strong isolation and supporting diverse OS environments. The choice between Docker Containers and VMs hinges on the specific requirements and priorities of the given application or workload.
